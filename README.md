## Introduction

Welcome to my MONUSEG2018 Challenge Report! This README provides a brief overview of my participation in the challenge. For comprehensive insights, please refer to the [Jupyter Notebook](link_to_ipynb_file.ipynb) with code implementation and the detailed [Challenge Report](link_to_full_report.pdf).

## Challenge Overview

The MONUSEG2018 Challenge was an exciting opportunity for researchers to advance segmentation techniques for microscopy images. The challenge revolved around segmenting diverse biological samples with complex cellular structures. The dataset included labeled training images and unlabeled test images for evaluation.

## Methodology

In tackling the challenge, I employed a multi-faceted approach that combined established techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and U-Net Architecture. Notably, I integrated watershed segmentation on the U-Net-generated probability maps to enhance the accuracy of segmenting intricate cellular regions.

## Results

My participation in the MONUSEG2018 challenge yielded promising results, especially in refining segmentations for challenging regions. For in-depth findings and analysis, please review the [Challenge Report](link_to_full_report.pdf).
